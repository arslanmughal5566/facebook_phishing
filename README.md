**Author** : Arslan Mughal



## About Script :

With this script you can perform Facebook login credentials stealing with some social engineering skills  

## requirements :

1 : [Python3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2 : Flask
To install Flask open terminal and type the following command ,

*root@kali~#*  **pip3 install flask**



make sure that before installing flask you have [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) install , if you are using windows or macOs then first download and install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

## usage :
clone the repository and open the terminal in source folder and run app.py 
root@kali~# python3 app.py
now open your browser and go to localhost:5000
facebook login page will appear type your credentials and hit login you will see nothing will be happen but stick with me :)

Go the source folder and then got database folder you will find one file name db_1 : 
**../database/db_1**
Open that and the credentials you have type in login page will be store in **db_1**  file 
 Now this is how you can attack on the same network but you can also do this attack out of Network using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) 
 


you can also attach some sort of image or any thing else with the link so that user immediately enter the credentials
